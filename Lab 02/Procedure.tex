This program was don in anaconda 3.8. The libraries included ski-kit, pandas, numpy
matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn. The data was collected from https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/
The missile type, facility name, and missile name were assigned a number and that number was used as the input. 
The out put was if the missile was a succes or failure. The data was not scaled. The neural network was trained on half the data and tested 
on the rest. The hidden layer consisted of 3 nodes in the first layer 3 nodes in the second layer. The random_state was 1
The cv was 4.The max_iter was 2000. The accuracy of the neural network was scored on the percentage of inputs matched to the correct output.
To verify the accuracy of the neural network was tested using the cross validation function.
